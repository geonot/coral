PARSER VALIDATION SUITE
-------------------------

This file serves as a placeholder. In a full compiler test, this would
contain the expected output (e.g., formatted AST, generated IR, or
program execution result) for the corresponding .cor file.

For now, its presence confirms that the test runner can find and pair
the test source with its expected outcome.
